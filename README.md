## Introduction:

In the 21st century, there have been many advancements in the entertainment industry such as the introduction of streaming services model. There has also been an overall surge in the general viewership of all things media since it has become so easy to consume, what with all of it being a few taps away at best. The accessibility that we've been provided makes it so that the options available to us are limitless and yet still, people only wish to stay within their comfort zone and continue watching that which they already enjoy.

The purpose of this survey was to determine which forms of media were the most attractive and which age groups they appealed to the most.

The means by which this survey was conducted was a google form. The form was circulated in multiple WhatsApp groups including both friends and family so that responses could be gathered from users from a variety of age groups. However, most of the respondents were still aged 18-22, even though the form was circulated in adult majority groups as well, likely because they didn't fill it out even after receiving the form, inducing a non-response error onto the data set.

Qualitative Data: Preference in media

Quantitative Data: Average number of hours spent in a day consuming media

## Questionnaire:

The questionnaire itself is linked below:

Since there was no need for it, the data collected does not include any personal information such as name, phone number, or email address.

There are three required fields out of which 1 is a choice question while the other two require direct input (in integers)

Even though there are validation checks in place making sure the answers for age and hours in a day were:

1. Numbers
2. Within a given range

There were still users that gave answers including the maximum possible answer (20 hours in a day spent consuming media) even though it logically makes no sense. This can be considered a case of response error.
